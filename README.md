The project.py represents the code with information that will be shown in the console, while the proj.py will represent the GUI in python.
The exe file represents the proj.py as an executable file, however it will not work unless it matches my account of the database used.
In order to have the GUI work on your end, the proj.py must be installed, changed the values accordingly to your case and then transform it into an exe file using PyInstaller or 
other tools.
